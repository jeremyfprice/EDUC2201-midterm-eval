mindmup and glogster and the ipad screenchomp
screen chomp 
glogster because it was an easy way to make a nice poster 
Glogster and because you can make more visual tools.
glogster and trello 
I like the screenchomp a lot. It was really cool to play around with.
I liked glogster, 
I LOVE Google drive, docs, the whole Google thing
I liked screen chomp and xmind! Because I like how I can incorporate technology into my teaching.
I really like the XMind app that we used.
I liked using the twitter for only the kids in this classroom while we watched the stand up comedian video.
Glogster was probably the most interesting because it shows how to set up a poster which is helpful when it comes to helping with programs and such. 
Laptop
i liked the one when we drew a picture and told a story as we drew it
I think Google Drive was pretty good. I like that we can share documents with each other and be able to edit them.


Taskstream, Google Drive, Screen Chomp
socrative and glogster
The laptop because we use it 90 percent of the time.
I like trello the best, because i use it and it is very helpful to keep track of my work.

x mind  and taskstream
Screenchomp because I just thought it will be a good tool for my classroom in the future. Glogster was another interesting one in that it will be a good classroom tool. 
I can't remember the specific name of the website, but I really enjoyed when we watched the video in class and the entire class could write their opinions of what we watched . It was cool to hear everyone's thoughts without having a big class dicussion and that everyone could see what everyone was writing. 
Xmind was interesting
I've liked taskstream a lot
