The students in EDUC2201 (Instructional Design) Sections 1 and 2 were asked to complete a mid-semester evaluation based on their experiences in the course so far. The evaluation was framed in two ways: first, that if I as the instructor was expected to provide an evaluation of students at the mid-semester point, it is only fair for students to provide an evaluation of the instructor; and second, this is their opportunity to make suggestions for providing feedback in terms of what is going well in the course and how they would like to see the course changed or improved.
