more stucture of outcomes
remind us about the due dates for papers and give us more time after the project to work on the paper and explain it more 
more hands on teaching 
Explain things more and be more clear and understanding.
explain things in better detail. 
N/a
I feel we waste a lot of time sometimes
I would change the students that I have class with haha I dislike that I got a B for the midterm when I feel that I've worked really hard in the class.
none what so ever!!!!
I don't really know what you could change, I'm just not as comfortable with the webquests.
I honestly do not think there is a whole lot of room for improvement. This is my favorite class and you endorse the atmosphere. 
youre very level headed and make it easy to approach, keep doing what youre doing
At the beginning of the semester take a day to show students how to access all computer and internet programs for those who are either not tech savvy, have not used computers or internet much or have a hard time connecting learning to the internet.
More time in class to do work in class
For the most part, I think the way it is taught is just fine. I don't think there needs to be any changes.


I think we should try to do one thing at a time.
Be more clear with assignments
We use alot of things for task stream and we just should use it for the big things. Its alot to turn things in.
The only thing that i would want to change is just to get the material explained a little better. Everything else is going great.

I think the class is well thought out.
I'd like to be told more of when things are due, as in make due dates clearer. 
My biggest struggle in this course was feeling lost at times. I felt that I didn't fully understand how or why we were doing things. I think clearer instruction would improve the course so new students understand the reason for what we do before we begin it. 
The way the course is taught
so far I like everything.
